> **Cliches for Clean Code** you better not overlook!
* DRY -- Don't repeat yourself  
* KISS -- Keep it simple, stupid  
* YAGNI -- You ain't gonna need it  
* SOLID -- Design Principles  
* MVC -- Architecture principle, Model View Controller  
* Design Patterns -- Some people already resolved our problem  
* Coding Standards/Conventions -- So we don't end up having different code with different coding styles among our team  
* RASAP -- Refactor as soon as possible  
* Don't reinvent the wheel -- Use existing libraries  


> "Writing clean code is what you must do in order to call yourself a professional. There is no reasonable excuse for doing anything less than your best."
